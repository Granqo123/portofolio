<h2>How did your love for anime came around and what do Anime do you recommend for new people coming across Anime?</h2>
<p>I came across Anime my first time whilst watching Dragon Ball after school and then it started just growing with every Anime I changed. The Anime I suggest to start is Death Note because you get the feel of Anime plot twists within the first episodes.</p>
