  <h2> Our Idea </h2>
  
  <img src="images/naruto 2.png" width="225" height="225" alt="Naruto 1"/>
 
  <p> Our Idea is that <a href="https://www.facebook.com/granit.rozhaja.5">me</a> and my friend <a href="https://www.facebook.com/klea.bushi.19">Klea</a> had an idea of starting an anime store due to our humongous love for anime and the feel on how it made us connect as friends. We thought of the opportunity and grasped it as soon as we had hte possibility. The plan is to start in Greece but achieve a worlwide audience and make Otakus all around the world connected</p>

  <h2> What we expect </h2>

  <p>
   Our expectations are that we will have a lot of customers coming as soon as COVID-19 has finished. We are in the verges of implementing a delivery system that will help otakus have their mangas/anime be delivered to their front door. The main goal is to spread the positivity and the twists the Anime World gives to people.

  <h2> What we achieved </h2>
  
  <img src="images/naruto 3.png" width="225" height="225" alt="Naruto 3"/>
  
  <p>We achieved to actually open a store here in Thessaloniki and we started a huge community through our online surveys that we sent out to all our friends and family here in Greece. This made the store recieve huge amounts of support and people are already ordering and messaging us. THEY WANT MORE.</p>
